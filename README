intro mission launch site: 59976

reserve space for external global vars
whole external script shares the space
lvar31 = thread ID
lvar30 = (external address + external var offset) / 4
access vars with: $_0[lvar30],$_4[lvar30],$_8[lvar30]


reserve global vars for temp compiler vars
spatial index script
  - array of active points
  - run init/loop/kill callbacks 
  - how to do persistence/vars/execution? separate script instances?
  - global array of event ID => timers (timers are packed int8 minutes until event can trigger)
  - local array of active event IDs
  - when near event location:
    - if local array slot free
      - add ID to local array
      - set global timer to 255 (executing)
      - spawn script with event details as args
    - else
      - do nothing (no free slots)
  - each tick:
    - for event ID in local array
      - if global array [event ID] == 255
        - do nothing (script executing)
      - else
        - remove event ID from local array
  - each minute:
    - subtract 1 from each timer in global array
  - each script:
    - receives arguments: event ID, xyzh coords, trigger distance
    - expected to shut down when outside distance
    - set global array [event ID] to next timeout in minutes 
for loop syntax
compile standard lib into externals, ease limit on main code

global vars: 560 bytes @ 21700 = 140 int32s

Things needed for release:

Scroll all lists (threads, local vars, global vars, regions list, repl)
Trim binaries down to just the important useful ones (assember/disassembler/debugger, shove the rest in a `tools` dir)
No-BS fast way to set up code reloader and open editor with scaffold code
Bootstrapper (don't need custom SCM for RPC/breakpoints/repl)
Better first-boot intro (offer a few simple options: Decompile main.scm, compile source code, init code reloader)
Show routine names in stack traces
Data stack implementation
better syntax for routines/functions
sublime text integration (compile/build menu)

* just show menu when r1 is pressed ??
do array check for car features (8 max?) (needs to be global through savegame? or not if detect script is external too?)
reverse syscall
export symbols for array vars
show include sizes for externals

dope wars style system
8 drugs, 8 locations

- vegas
- desert
- bayside
- san fierro
- mountains
- countryside
- los santos east
- los santos west

supply[area][drug] = 0-15 (bitpack as 4 bits = 8 ints in int32)
demand[area][drug] = 0-15

demand has constant base, variable +/- effects
supply has base, can be changed by player deals (with decay to base), variable +/- effects

bootstrap script code required:

  $SCRIPTS_RUNNING - script ready to load vars (set bitmask once script is running)
  $SCRIPTS_TERMINATE - script ready to exit vars (set bitmask to tell script to self-terminate, clear when done)

  main script extension:
    * spawn_scripts()

  save script extension:
    * safely shut down all scripts

  rpc handler:

  breakpoint and repl handlers:

  spawn_scripts():
    * spawn script if $SCRIPTS_RUNNING[script_id] == 0

  shutdown_scripts():
    * set all $SCRIPTS_TERMINATE bits

  is_scripts_shutdown_complete():
    * return true if all $SCRIPTS_TERMINATE bits are unset

classes

SCM: holds raw bytes, lazy-loads or preloads instruction offsets/disassembled instructions
Assembler: takes raw tokens and assembles bytecode at defined positions, and symbols
Compiler: takes ruby code and emits raw tokens
Instruction: convenient reader/writer methods
Script: convenient reader/writer methods
Process: convenience methods + read SCM/scripts from memory, can load symbols
Analyser: loads bytecode, calculates jumps/blocks

GTAV memdump notes:
1130934 (main)
14921914 main

* debugger: run without bootstrap script (inject rpc/repl code, find+patch main loop to run them)

* filter opcodes to only ones used in-game (are there other supported ones that are unused?)
* debugger: add/remove gvars from console
* use `subl` app to show disassembly, new script template

* debugger: control debugger features from console (add gvars, read/write memory, etc.)
  - launch/kill game
  - inject any script
  - set script
  - use hex for input/output where appropriate
  - read/write local vars
  - read/write global vars
  - read/write scm memory
  - read/write game memory
  - disassemble instruction at offset
  - patch instruction at offset
  - insert breakpoint at offset
  - handle breakpoint in repl
* debugger: scrollable lists/tables everywhere
* debugger: regions list - maybe replaces code injector
  - detect MAIN + external script's memspaces + block allocator spaces
* debugger: disassemble bytecode in background thread

* compiler: dump all instruction offsets to symbols
* debugger repl: easy-to-use (don't require injection/attachment)
* debugger repl: use local vars instead of global?
* debugger: enable auto-reload, toggle settings, choose files

* debugger: flag on whether to alias script local vars to ruby local vars
* debugger: flag on whether to alias global local vars to ruby global vars
* debugger/compiler: generate symbols that can be used for injected code/strange base offsets
* debugger: DONE: hotkeys, convert all to ctrl+key, ensure no weird focus stuff
* debugger: allow copying text properly
* compiler: handle more errors


* RESOLVED: debugger+code: make breakpoint handler larger, dynamic? (need multiple code sites for multiple dynamic executions)
* RESOLVED: debugger: bulk instruction calls + return values
* RESOLVED: debugger: try to speed up (2nd-level proxy for executing in multiple repl scripts?)
* DONE: debugger: ensure breakpoints work with new repl
* DONE: debugger: cache process.threads calls on each update call

* DONE: generate call graph
  detect all opcodes that use labels (start_mission/switch/headers/etc.)

  is it safe to use if each script leaves the stack empty before yielding?

* DONE: debugger: more mouse click events
* debugger: finalise script viewer
* debugger: persist panels settings
* DONE: debugger: hook up code reloader
* DONE: debugger: hook up repl


* docs: generate list of used/supported opcodes in SA



* code reloader:
  get malloc space
  insert header+code
  header: magic string, size of code, routine offsets for: init/loop/shutdown, base offsets (mem+scm relative)
  when new code is inserted, either:
    * trigger shutdown of old code, start new code
    * trigger old code to jump to new code, retaining local var state
    debug_string("binary data with header")
    init()
    jump(to_next_instruction)
    loop()
    jump(to_next_instruction)
    shutdown()
    jump(to_next_instruction)
    terminate_this_script()
    routines {
      init{}
      loop{}
      shutdown{}
    }

  to halt current code, look at loop_offset, read wait instruction, write return instruction immediately afterwards
  control whether it reloads or shutsdown/reinits by altering main body jumps
  entry/re-entry points: with init: body+0, without init: body+14

  UI columns:
  filename (16+)+3
  mode (6)+3
  injected at (9)+3
  status (the rest)

Features
--------


In-game VM Documentation
-------------

* Can access memory outside of Variables space
* Can kill all running threads with terminate_this_script
* Some .gxt entries require load_mission_text (OVALRIG/HOTR_05)
* Self-modifying code allowed
  * Limits? presumably only first 64kb due to int16 var size
* Integer overflow
  * Overflows from 2147483647 -> -2147483648
* Local variables
  * Per-thread
  * start_new_script takes (offset,*var_args), each nth arg gets assigned to lvar n-1
    ie. start_new_script(1000,50,333) sets (lvar 0) = 50, (lvar 1) = 333
* Out-of-bounds variables
  * var reads outside of memory appear to return 0
  * but writing anything out-of-bounds makes subsequent reads return -68
  * doesn't appear to be wrap-around or shadowing
  * same for lvars
  * terrifying

* Can crash if threads don't yield with wait (?)
* San Andreas can handle ~24,000 noops without crashing (confirm this - i think i just overwrote my main code)

Check:

* Can you use negative jump offsets in normal scripts? how do they behave?
* Out-of-bounds array access
